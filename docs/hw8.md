## Project Idea:

### How do we spot bias in data?
If we can remove bias in data, will it help learners to be more unbiased?

### How do we improve learners explanability?
* Given that there are lots of learners out there, how could we improve the learners so 
it could be more explainable?
* How do we create AI output that is human-friendly? (AI that layman coild easily interpret)
  - **explain to justify**: the decisions made by utilising an underlying model should be explained in order to increase their justifiability;
  - **explain to control**: explanations should enhance the transparency of a model and its functioning, allowing its debugging and the identification of potential flaws; 
  - **explain to improve**: explanations should help scholars improve the accuracy and effimciency of their models;
  - **explain to discover**: explanations should support the extraction of novel knowledge and
    the learning of relationships and patterns
